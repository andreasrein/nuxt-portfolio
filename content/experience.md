## Feelgood AB | Frontend Developer
### APR 2018 - APR 2023

At Feelgood I learned a lot, I was given more and more responsibility throughout the years. When I first joined the team I was one of two frontend developers in a team of six. I later became more of a frontend lead given my experience and having colleagues joining and leaving the team. 

My initial assignment at Feelgood was to develop a web application to be used at all reception desks in Feelgood´s Swedish (60+) locations. In addition to developing the web application I was also involved in expanding the project by visiting receptions where this solution was needed for pilot testing and collecting feedback from users and administrators. From that initial task I was offered to be a permanent member of the tech team, working on Feelgood’s other digital solutions.
When I started working with their main product, the customer portal, it had several related web applications connected to it to be able to administrate orders, bookings, personnel data and general configurations per company. There was a need for a unified design and together with a UX designer, I developed a design system with web components to get a more modular way of working with the front end.

I also had the opportunity to develop the customer service solution together with my team, which was used as an everyday tool by the phone support to be able to quickly search and find specific doctors and nurses based on skill set and geographic location.

## Alcesys AB | Fullstack Developer
### FEB 2020 - JUL 2020

I worked in a team together with another developer making the technical decisions, design implementation, development and deployment of the site. Iterating and implementing a new interface for the company website. The goal was to build a slim and cost effective site that exactly met the requirements, no more and no less. Requirements of the project made static-sites a perfect fit. The site was built with React along with the static site generator Gatsby, gaining advantage in performance with pre-rendered content as well as the benefits of read-only hosting. A custom CMS was built taking advantage of Git functionality to manage the content instead of making the site dependable upon a third-party CMS.

**Tools:** *React, Gatsby, GraphQL, SCSS, Git, GitLab, Static sites, JAMstack, design, Responsive design, Agile*
