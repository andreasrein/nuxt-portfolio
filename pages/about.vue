        I am a curious and driven developer who is constantly seeking new challenges. It all started with a small high school course. It was at this time I realized that you could combine color and shape with technology in a creative way.
I have long been interested in music and art, but it wasn't until now that I discovered the magic that could be created on a computer screen using HTML and CSS.

      <p class="mb-4">
        I followed that path, and today I call myself a Frontend/Fullstack developer. I studied at Mediainstitutet in Stockholm where I learned the basics of object-oriented programming. I learned about databases, UX, and delved into JavaScript and its plethora of frameworks. This later led me to an internship at a consulting company where I worked on real in-house projects.

        With my previous aesthetic interests, I feel like a strong frontend developer with an eye and a feel for details. This greatly facilitates my work as I now closely collaborate with designers.
