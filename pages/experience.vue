          Andreas has evolved his role at Feelgood, he learnt a lot, and been given more and more responsibility throughout the years. When Andreas joined the team he was one of two front end developers in a team of six. He later on became more of a lead developer for the frontend as colleagues joined and left the team. Andreas became a much appreciated co-worker, known for his problem solving skills and high sense of responsibility during his time at Feelgood.

          The initial assignment at Feelgood was to develop a web application to be used at all reception desks in Feelgood’s Swedish locations. In addition to developing the web application he also drove the project's expansion by visiting receptions where this solution was needed for pilot testing and collecting feedback from users and administrators. From that initial task Andreas was offered to be a permanent member of the tech team, working on Feelgood’s other digital solutions.

          When Andreas started working with their main product, the customer portal, it had several related web applications connected to it to be able to administrate orders, bookings, personnel data and general configurations per company. There was a need for a unified design and together with a UX designer, Andreas developed a design system with web components to get a more modular way of working with the front end.
          Andreas also developed the customer service solution together with his team, which was used as an everyday tool by the phone support to be able to quickly search and find specific doctors and nurses based on skill set and geographic location.
